## Myntra Hackerramp-2021
We wanted to revamp myntra in such a way that the users won’t have to switch apps to look for influencers’ content (like videos and reels), latest fashion trends, and styling tips. So we brought all these features to a single platform.

Apart from the verified influencers, we give every single user to have a profile of their own where they can create outfits, get likes and eventually get brand sponsors: all of it right in the myntra studio.

Also, we created a dress up game where users can choose their avatars, dress them up (quite like how bitmojis work) but with a difference that the clothes that they choose are actual myntra products. So at the end of creating an outfit, they can shop the whole look or simply showcase their creating at their profile page.

So, We came up with a bunch of features which are an extension to the current myntra app.
